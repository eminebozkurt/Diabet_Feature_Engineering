# Business Problem
It is asked to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. It is expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.


# Dataset
The dataset is part of a larger dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the USA. It is the data used for a diabetes survey of Pima Indian women aged 21 years and older living in the city of Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona, USA.
The target variable is "outcome", where 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicates a negative test result.
